# Deno REST Example

A simple REST API starter kit implementation in Deno environment using OAK as middleware framework.

The app contains basics CRUD operation managing a Book entity using at the moment a simple Interface for modeling the REST Entity with read and write operation in an array collection.

In the future I will improve this example adding database and authentication support.


## Usage

```
deno run --allow-net server.ts
```
